# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to
# override settings for certain messages.
#
# Messages can be matched by
#    appname (discouraged, see desktop_entry)
#    body
#    category
#    desktop_entry
#    icon
#    match_transient
#    msg_urgency
#    stack_tag
#    summary
#
# and you can override the
#    background
#    foreground
#    format
#    frame_color
#    fullscreen
#    new_icon
#    set_stack_tag
#    set_transient
#    set_category
#    timeout
#    urgency
#    icon_position
#    skip_display
#    history_ignore
#    action_name
#    word_wrap
#    ellipsize
#    alignment
#    hide_text
#
# Shell-like globbing will get expanded.
#
# Instead of the appname filter, it's recommended to use the desktop_entry filter.
# GLib based applications export their desktop-entry name. In comparison to the appname,
# the desktop-entry won't get localized.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
